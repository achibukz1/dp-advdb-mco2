MySQL-Based Distributed Lock Manager

This module provides distributed locking using MySQL tables across multiple database nodes.
Unlike Redis-based locking, this approach uses the existing MySQL infrastructure,
making it ideal for Google Cloud deployments without additional services.

Each MySQL node has a 'distributed_lock' table that tracks lock ownership.
The lock manager coordinates locks across all three nodes to ensure consistency.
